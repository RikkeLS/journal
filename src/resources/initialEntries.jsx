    notes:'I am not sure if thinking is a waste of time to begin with. Then collective thinking is more precious than the time, because I think time goes by anyway, and it is about how we use it. So the waste a time is the time we are not using for the greater good or a higher purpose. Being selfish and working on your own project for your own self my be the optimal waste of time.'
